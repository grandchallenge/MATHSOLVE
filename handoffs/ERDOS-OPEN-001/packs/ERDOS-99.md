# Erdős Problem 99 — bounded reconnaissance/source/adversarial pack

This is a complete **pre-launch** work-package pack. It defines bounded assignments but authorizes no contributor execution. A later protected activation transaction must bind each assignment to one GitHub issue, one dispatch ID, one agent reference, and one lease identity before any prompt is executable.

## Protected problem statement

For all sufficiently large n, must every n-point planar set of minimum pairwise distance 1 that minimizes diameter contain a unit equilateral triangle?

Protected facts that may be used without re-derivation:
1. The protected formalization fixes minimum distance 1 and asks about global diameter minimizers.
2. The target is eventual in n; small counterexamples would not by themselves refute it.

No pack member may infer that the problem is solved, easier than other Erdős problems, novel to GCL, or certified. The protected registry status is intake evidence, not MATHCERT authority.


## Blind-lane rule

When activated as a cohort, R/S/A returns are independent until all intended evidence is preserved. A worker must not inspect sibling returns. Source audit may inspect primary literature; reconnaissance and adversarial lanes may not use the source-lane return during their first pass.

# WP-R — bounded mathematical reconnaissance

PROPOSED_ASSIGNMENT_ID: ERDOS-99-R1
TIMEBOX_IF_ACTIVATED: 35 minutes
EXTERNAL_SOURCES: PROTECTED_PACKET_ONLY
MODE: INDEPENDENT_BLIND_RECONNAISSANCE

You are an independent zero-context mathematical contributor. Work only from the protected packet above and standard mathematics. Do not inspect sibling packets/returns, campaign discussions, pull requests, unpublished GCL notes, or external literature.

## Exact assignment

1. Translate a diameter minimizer into a contact-graph/rigidity problem: unit-distance edges, diameter-realizing pairs, and first-order motions that could reduce diameter while preserving minimum distance.
2. For a bounded small range of n, enumerate or source exact candidate contact graphs and use exact/interval geometry where possible to test whether triangle-free contact graphs can be global minimizers.
3. The mathematical deliverable is not a numerical packing table; it is one rigorous local-rigidity or contact-graph lemma that any sufficiently large counterexample would have to satisfy.
4. Return exact certificates where available and clearly separate global optimality from local stationarity.

## Success criterion

A successful return is the strongest one of: an exact reduction; a rigorously delimited finite certificate; a reproducible exact computation with a theorem-grade interpretation boundary; or the smallest explicit missing lemma. “I could not solve it” is not a useful return unless accompanied by an exact blocker.

## Return discipline if activated

Return exactly one narrative `GCL-CONTRIBUTION-RESULT/1` on the bound issue:

```text
GCL-CONTRIBUTION-RESULT/1
dispatch_id: <BOUND_AT_ACTIVATION>
agent_ref: <BOUND_AT_ACTIVATION>

# WP-S — primary-source interface audit

PROPOSED_ASSIGNMENT_ID: ERDOS-99-S1
TIMEBOX_IF_ACTIVATED: 35 minutes
EXTERNAL_SOURCES: PRIMARY_SOURCES_REQUIRED
MODE: INDEPENDENT_SOURCE_AUDIT

You are an independent zero-context source contributor. Start from the canonical registry page and the protected formalization. Primary papers/preprints/books are preferred; secondary sources may be used only to locate primary evidence. Do not inspect sibling returns or unpublished GCL material.

Seed citation labels already present in the protected packet: none; recover the primary bibliography from the canonical registry page.

## Exact assignment

1. Resolve the canonical problem page and primary literature on minimum-diameter n-point sets with prescribed minimum distance.
2. Identify exact solved n, known optimal configurations, asymptotic diameter bounds, and results about contact graphs/equilateral triangles.
3. Record which results prove global optimality and which are numerical/conjectural. Match normalization conventions to minimum distance 1.

## Required source output

Return exact bibliographic identities, stable URLs/DOIs/arXiv identifiers when available, theorem/page/section locations, quoted terminology only when necessary, and a dependency table:
`source claim → exact hypotheses → relevance to protected target → semantic match/conflict → confidence`.

Do not report “current best known” without a dated primary source or an explicit statement that the audit could not establish currency.

## Return discipline if activated

Return exactly one narrative `GCL-CONTRIBUTION-RESULT/1` on the bound issue:

```text
GCL-CONTRIBUTION-RESULT/1
dispatch_id: <BOUND_AT_ACTIVATION>
agent_ref: <BOUND_AT_ACTIVATION>

# WP-A — adversarial falsification / route attack

PROPOSED_ASSIGNMENT_ID: ERDOS-99-A1
TIMEBOX_IF_ACTIVATED: 35 minutes
EXTERNAL_SOURCES: PROTECTED_PACKET_ONLY
MODE: INDEPENDENT_BLIND_ADVERSARY

You are an independent zero-context adversarial mathematical contributor. Work from the protected packet and standard mathematics only. Do not inspect the reconnaissance or source returns.

## Exact assignment

1. Attack the heuristic `global diameter minimizer ⇒ triangular contact graph/equilateral triangle`.
2. Construct triangle-free locally rigid unit-distance/contact configurations, or numerical near-minimizers, to show which local conditions are insufficient.
3. Test whether an argument accidentally assumes uniqueness, genericity, or every active constraint being a unit-distance edge.
4. Return an explicit configuration defeating a proposed local criterion or a minimal set of additional global conditions.

## Success criterion

Preferred: an explicit counterexample to a proposed bridge, reduction, pruning rule, semantic identification, or local criterion. Otherwise return a rigorous elimination ledger and the first remaining unsafe inference. Failure to refute the full Erdős statement is not evidence for it.

## Return discipline if activated

Return exactly one narrative `GCL-CONTRIBUTION-RESULT/1` on the bound issue:

```text
GCL-CONTRIBUTION-RESULT/1
dispatch_id: <BOUND_AT_ACTIVATION>
agent_ref: <BOUND_AT_ACTIVATION>
assignment: ERDOS-99-A1

## Pack synthesis gate

This pack is not a campaign. After activation and durable preservation of returns, synthesis may open only when at least one R return and one A return exist; S is required before any literature-dependent claim is promoted. Synthesis must select the smallest native GCL theorem/obstruction and create a new protected work package. Nothing in this pack directly authorizes a theorem claim, a Solve campaign, or certification.
