# Erdős Problem 101 — bounded reconnaissance/source/adversarial pack

This is a complete **pre-launch** work-package pack. It defines bounded assignments but authorizes no contributor execution. A later protected activation transaction must bind each assignment to one GitHub issue, one dispatch ID, one agent reference, and one lease identity before any prompt is executable.

## Protected problem statement

For n planar points with no five collinear, is the maximum number of lines containing exactly four points o(n^2)?

Protected facts that may be used without re-derivation:
1. Simple pair counting gives only an O(n^2) scale; the target requires a genuinely geometric saving.
2. Each 4-rich line consumes six unordered point-pairs, but abstract linear 4-uniform designs need not be realizable by straight lines.

No pack member may infer that the problem is solved, easier than other Erdős problems, novel to GCL, or certified. The protected registry status is intake evidence, not MATHCERT authority.


## Blind-lane rule

When activated as a cohort, R/S/A returns are independent until all intended evidence is preserved. A worker must not inspect sibling returns. Source audit may inspect primary literature; reconnaissance and adversarial lanes may not use the source-lane return during their first pass.

# WP-R — bounded mathematical reconnaissance

PROPOSED_ASSIGNMENT_ID: ERDOS-101-R1
TIMEBOX_IF_ACTIVATED: 35 minutes
EXTERNAL_SOURCES: PROTECTED_PACKET_ONLY
MODE: INDEPENDENT_BLIND_RECONNAISSANCE

You are an independent zero-context mathematical contributor. Work only from the protected packet above and standard mathematics. Do not inspect sibling packets/returns, campaign discussions, pull requests, unpublished GCL notes, or external literature.

## Exact assignment

1. Derive the sharpest elementary incidence bounds obtainable from pair counting and standard point-line incidence inequalities, with constants explicit enough to see exactly why they stop at O(n^2).
2. Reformulate a hypothetical Θ(n^2) counterexample as a dense 4-uniform linear incidence design plus geometric realizability constraints.
3. Identify one specific geometric obstruction that any near-Steiner incidence pattern would violate, and formulate it as a finite theorem/lemma suitable for independent proof.
4. Optional bounded computation: enumerate small combinatorial 4-uniform linear designs and test realizability obstructions, but do not treat nonrealizability numerics as proof.

## Success criterion

A successful return is the strongest one of: an exact reduction; a rigorously delimited finite certificate; a reproducible exact computation with a theorem-grade interpretation boundary; or the smallest explicit missing lemma. “I could not solve it” is not a useful return unless accompanied by an exact blocker.

## Return discipline if activated

Return exactly one narrative `GCL-CONTRIBUTION-RESULT/1` on the bound issue:

```text
GCL-CONTRIBUTION-RESULT/1
dispatch_id: <BOUND_AT_ACTIVATION>
agent_ref: <BOUND_AT_ACTIVATION>

No branch, pull request, attachment, second mathematical comment, certification claim, or canonical mutation is authorized.

# WP-S — primary-source interface audit

PROPOSED_ASSIGNMENT_ID: ERDOS-101-S1
TIMEBOX_IF_ACTIVATED: 35 minutes
EXTERNAL_SOURCES: PRIMARY_SOURCES_REQUIRED
MODE: INDEPENDENT_SOURCE_AUDIT

You are an independent zero-context source contributor. Start from the canonical registry page and the protected formalization. Primary papers/preprints/books are preferred; secondary sources may be used only to locate primary evidence. Do not inspect sibling returns or unpublished GCL material.

Seed citation labels already present in the protected packet: none; recover the primary bibliography from the canonical registry page.

## Exact assignment

1. Resolve the canonical problem page and primary literature on 4-rich lines under the no-five-collinear condition.
2. Audit known incidence bounds and any later improvements directly relevant to little-o(n^2), distinguishing general Szemerédi–Trotter-type estimates from results using the multiplicity cap four.
3. Build a dependency map of geometric versus purely combinatorial inputs and state the best current exponent/order supported by primary sources.

## Required source output

Return exact bibliographic identities, stable URLs/DOIs/arXiv identifiers when available, theorem/page/section locations, quoted terminology only when necessary, and a dependency table:
`source claim → exact hypotheses → relevance to protected target → semantic match/conflict → confidence`.

Do not report “current best known” without a dated primary source or an explicit statement that the audit could not establish currency.

## Return discipline if activated

Return exactly one narrative `GCL-CONTRIBUTION-RESULT/1` on the bound issue:

```text
GCL-CONTRIBUTION-RESULT/1
dispatch_id: <BOUND_AT_ACTIVATION>
agent_ref: <BOUND_AT_ACTIVATION>
assignment: ERDOS-101-S1

context_class: ZERO_CONTEXT
external_sources: <AS_DECLARED_BY_LANE>

# WP-A — adversarial falsification / route attack

PROPOSED_ASSIGNMENT_ID: ERDOS-101-A1
TIMEBOX_IF_ACTIVATED: 35 minutes
EXTERNAL_SOURCES: PROTECTED_PACKET_ONLY
MODE: INDEPENDENT_BLIND_ADVERSARY

You are an independent zero-context adversarial mathematical contributor. Work from the protected packet and standard mathematics only. Do not inspect the reconnaissance or source returns.

## Exact assignment

1. Attack any purely combinatorial route to o(n^2) by exhibiting abstract linear 4-uniform designs with Θ(n^2) blocks when possible.
2. Then isolate exactly which straight-line realizability axiom those designs violate; pair-counting alone is not allowed as a claimed obstruction.
3. Stress applications of incidence theorems for hidden hypotheses, especially whether they count all rich lines, exactly-4 lines, or allow five-plus collinear points.
4. Return a concrete combinatorial countermodel to a proposed proof route or the first unavoidable geometric lemma.

## Success criterion

Preferred: an explicit counterexample to a proposed bridge, reduction, pruning rule, semantic identification, or local criterion. Otherwise return a rigorous elimination ledger and the first remaining unsafe inference. Failure to refute the full Erdős statement is not evidence for it.

## Return discipline if activated

Return exactly one narrative `GCL-CONTRIBUTION-RESULT/1` on the bound issue:

```text
GCL-CONTRIBUTION-RESULT/1
dispatch_id: <BOUND_AT_ACTIVATION>
agent_ref: <BOUND_AT_ACTIVATION>
assignment: ERDOS-101-A1
disposition: <EXACT_REDUCTION|FINITE_CERTIFICATE|SOURCE_INTERFACE_FOUND|COUNTEREXAMPLE|EXACT_BLOCKER|NO_MATERIAL_DELTA>
context_class: ZERO_CONTEXT

## Strongest exact statement

## Pack synthesis gate

This pack is not a campaign. After activation and durable preservation of returns, synthesis may open only when at least one R return and one A return exist; S is required before any literature-dependent claim is promoted. Synthesis must select the smallest native GCL theorem/obstruction and create a new protected work package. Nothing in this pack directly authorizes a theorem claim, a Solve campaign, or certification.
